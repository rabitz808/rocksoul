  <p> In recent years, the development of the e-sports industry has become increasingly prosperous. Along with the
    e-sports project itself, hardware equipment has also been a major focus, especially with e-sports monitors.
    ROCKSOUL, which has top-notch computer R&D technology, held a new product launch on Tutor ABC (T Hall) on April 20.
    A series of e-sports mouses, keyboards and headphones, such as the new RSMS and RSKB, were released on the spot. In
    this past month, ROCKSOUL just released their latest 32 and 27 inch 2K QHD Curved Gaming Monitor 2560×1440 2K
    Widescreen; Adjustable Stand, 1440P Resolution & FreeSync Samsung VA Panel. </p>

  <p> Founded in 2009, ROCKSOUL specializes in high-quality computer peripheral products. ROCKSOUL’s product line is the
    result of incredible attention to detail in design and development, along with the relentless pursuit of quality,
    feeling, and functionality. Spanning over 12,000 kilometers, ROCKSOUL capitalizes on creative labs in Los Angeles,
    California.With top-notch products and services, ROCKSOUL is aiming to become the peripheral of choice at the
    fingertips of millions of users around the world. They are the “Gamer’s Best Friend.” Their products come at high
    quality, high functionality, and at an affordable price point. All that you have ever dreamed of for your ideal user
    experience, they aim to deliver.Today, ROCKSOUL continues to focus on their core concept as a brand, tapping into
    new sales channels and acquiring the best technology in computer peripherals for our players all over the world.
    After 10 years of operation, they at ROCKSOUL are excited and are looking forward to another 10 years of delivering
    excellent service to you, the Gamer.</p>

  <p>ROCKSOUL believes that “all true technological innovation comes out of the user experience and user feedback, which
    together represents gamers’ ever-evolving search for the ultimate gaming experience”. To be the best, there is no
    alternative. But to be every GAMER’S BEST FRIEND, ROCKSOUL must maintain its position at the top of the class in
    hardware device design. This is a challenge we eagerly accept, as it means even more opportunities to thrill and
    move our fans.</p>

  <p>ROCKSOUL, therefore, embodies a flourishing ecosystem comprising of “roots, branches, and leaves” suffused with the
    spirit. In one fell swoop, they are now cooperating with the largest retail outlets. In addition to pursuing higher
    quality and performance benchmarks, they also strive to provide the most diverse product line among our competitors,
    while offering the most convenient consumer purchasing platform and most attentive after-sales services; taken
    together, these goals represent the original spirit of ROCKSOUL.</p>

  <p>ROCKSOUL maintains a strategic position in America’s popular competitive gaming market, firmly rooted in our
    insistence on preserving their grassroots commitment to customer service. They sponsor not only the original
    competitive gaming national team, but also competitive gaming teams from other countries; they assist them with
    resources, technology, and other professional services.</p>

  <p>ROCKSOUL understands the importance of continuing to cultivate the most phenomenal user experiences, so that they
    can fully realize their company vision of “GAMER’ S BEST FRIEND”.</p>

  <p>The latest report released by data analysis agency Newzoo shows that in the 21- to 35-year-old American male
    demographic, the number of people watching e-sports exceeds that of baseball or ice hockey, and the proportion of
    the latter two types of fans is 22%. This data is especially important for advertisers who target young men. Newzoo
    predicts that by 2019, the e-sports industry will generate $1.1 billion in revenue. Such growth will surely attract
    the attention of investors, traditional sports groups and team owners.</p>

  <p>“Sports stars, clubs, media companies, and brands have a great interest in e-sports. This shows that the game is
    leading the media and entertainment industry into a new era of unity.” Newzoo said in an email to the media, “The
    game triggers a revolution in technology and consumer industry models, and has a unique affinity for the younger
    generation to actively engage them. Traditional digital media and sports companies have years of experience in
    providing effective communication platforms for advertisers. Furthermore, they could become strategic business
    partners.”</p>

  <p>Unlike the older generation, today’s younger population play video games from an early age, and the appreciation of
    e-sports is innate. As you age, the number of fans of e-sports will only increase. This also explains why e-sports
    and American football in the United States have little overlap in terms of fans: According to Newzoo, 56% of
    American football fans are older than 35, and 73% of e-sports fans are younger than 35 years old.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, e-sports is more in line with the younger generation’s viewing habits – they prefer Twitch,
    YouTube, and other live broadcast platforms, rather than traditional cable TV. Many baseball and ice hockey teams
    have signed an exclusive live broadcast agreement with cable TV, so they lose support from the younger generation.
    Perhaps the NBA and NFL are better for live streaming than MLB or NHL.</p>
